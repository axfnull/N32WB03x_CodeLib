1. Function description
    This routine demonstrates the basic functions and algorithms of hardware CRC.
    
    Among them, there are 16bit checksum and 32bit checksum,
    

2. Use environment
    Software development environment: KEIL MDK-ARM V5.30.0.0
    Hardware environment: Developed based on the development board N32WB031_STB


3. Instructions for use

    /* Describe related module configuration methods; for example: clock, I/O, etc. */
        SystemClock: HSIï¼š64MHz
        Log print: DEMO board PB6(TX), baud rate: 115200, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity bit, no hardware flow control
        
    /* Describe the test steps and phenomena of the Demo */
         1. After compiling, download the program to reset and run;
         2. You can check the CRC result in Log.
